[ControllerMode](ftc/teamcode/ControllerMode.java) is the main teleop program that we run. It contains the methods to run the robot with controllers. A base code to move the wheels will stay the same and we add code for the attachments added each season.<br />
[stateRed/BlueCorners](ftc/teamcode/StateBlueCorners.java) is the file that contains the individual commands to run the autonomous. The different files contain the different positions for the robot to start.
